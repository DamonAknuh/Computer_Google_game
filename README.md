# Computer_Google_game
## Project Objective: 

The project objective is simply to build a program to autonomously play the google game. For the core of this prject I want to use Python and OpenCV. Then I shall expand to something like a neural network to test how well that does. 
Game URL: http://www.trex-game.skipser.com/

## Learning Goals:

* Familiarity with Coding in python
* Familiarity with OpenCV Library
* Familiarity with training and setting up Nueral Networks

## Tutorials
